[MongoDB][1] is a popular NoSQL document oriented database. F# is a strongly
typed functional language for .NET, similar to OCaml or Haskell. There is a
great [driver for C#][2] that gives us most of the infrastructure that we need
for F#. However, F# has many special types to support the functional paradigm -
such as immutable lists, immutable record types and discriminated unions (to 
name a few).
